# UI/UX Design

## Design Principles

- **Clarity:** Minimalist, distraction-free interface to keep users focused on gameplay and analysis.
- **Responsiveness:** Layout adapts seamlessly to desktop and mobile devices.
- **Feedback:** Immediate visual and interactive feedback for all user actions (e.g., move highlights, analysis progress, error states).
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, color contrast, and screen reader support via shadcn/ui and Radix UI.
- **Consistency:** Uniform styling and component usage across the application.
- **Modularity:** Reusable, composable UI components for maintainability and scalability.

## User Journey

1. **Landing:** User opens the app and sees the checkers board, control panel, and analysis tools.
2. **Setup/Play:** User chooses between setup mode (placing pieces) or play mode (drag-and-drop moves).
3. **Interaction:** User makes moves, flips the board, or configures rules.
4. **Analysis:** User requests AI analysis; receives visual feedback (evaluation bar, move arrows, engine lines).
5. **Review:** User inspects move history, analysis results, and can reset or clear the board.
6. **Persistence:** User can save or load game states (API integration).

## Wireframe & Flow Descriptions

### Main Layout
- **Header:** App title and brief description.
- **Main Area:**
  - **Left (or Top on mobile):** Checkers board with drag-and-drop, move highlights, and piece indicators.
  - **Right (or Bottom on mobile):** Control panel for game/analysis controls, mode switching, and settings.
  - **Below Board:**
    - **Evaluation Bar:** Visualizes position advantage (red vs. black).
    - **Analysis Results:** Detailed metrics and progress.
    - **Engine Lines:** Top move suggestions with quality rankings and hover effects.

### Component Flow
- **CheckersBoard:** Receives position, legal moves, and user actions; emits move events.
- **ControlPanel:** Manages game state, analysis depth, mode, and rule settings.
- **EvaluationBar:** Updates in real-time with analysis results.
- **AnalysisResults:** Shows evaluation breakdown, last analysis time, and progress.
- **EngineLines:** Lists top moves, allows hover to preview.

## Accessibility Considerations

- **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements are focusable and operable via keyboard.
- **Screen Reader Support:** ARIA labels and roles for all controls and board squares.
- **Color Contrast:** Sufficient contrast for all text and UI elements; colorblind-friendly palette.
- **Motion Preferences:** Respects user settings for reduced motion.
- **Tooltips:** Contextual tooltips for controls and analysis features.
