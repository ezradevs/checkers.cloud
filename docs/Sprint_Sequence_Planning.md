# Sprint Sequence Planning

## Overview
This document outlines the sprint-based development plan for the Checkers Analysis Tool. Each sprint includes goals, deliverables, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and risk mitigation strategies. The plan is designed for iterative, incremental delivery with clear milestones.

---

## Sprint 1: Project Foundation
- **Goals:**
  - Set up monorepo structure (`client/`, `server/`, `shared/`).
  - Configure TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Express.js.
  - Establish shared types and initial project scaffolding.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Working dev environment for frontend and backend.
  - Initial README and setup documentation.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Both client and server can be started independently.
  - Shared types are importable in both codebases.
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Risks:** Misconfigured tooling; mitigated by using templates and documentation.

---

## Sprint 2: Core Gameplay
- **Goals:**
  - Implement checkers board rendering and drag-and-drop logic.
  - Develop move validation, legal move highlighting, and multi-jump support.
  - Add setup mode for custom positions.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Interactive board with legal move enforcement.
  - Setup mode toggle and UI.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Users can play a full game against themselves.
  - All legal moves and multi-jumps are supported.
- **Dependencies:** Sprint 1
- **Risks:** Complex move logic; mitigated by incremental implementation and unit tests.

---

## Sprint 3: AI & Analysis
- **Goals:**
  - Integrate custom minimax engine with alpha-beta pruning.
  - Implement evaluation function (material, positional, mobility, strategic).
  - Add analysis depth configuration and result caching.
- **Deliverables:**
  - AI analysis available from the UI.
  - Visual feedback: evaluation bar, move arrows, engine lines.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Users can request analysis and see best move suggestions.
  - Analysis is accurate and performant at all depths.
- **Dependencies:** Sprint 2
- **Risks:** AI performance; mitigated by depth limits and move ordering.

---

## Sprint 4: UI/UX Enhancements
- **Goals:**
  - Modularize UI into reusable components.
  - Integrate shadcn/ui and Radix UI for accessibility.
  - Improve layout for responsiveness and clarity.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Componentized UI (CheckersBoard, ControlPanel, EvaluationBar, etc.).
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - All UI components are accessible and responsive.
  - Visual feedback is clear and immediate.
- **Dependencies:** Sprint 3
- **Risks:** Accessibility gaps; mitigated by using proven UI libraries.

---

## Sprint 5: Persistence & Polish
- **Goals:**
  - Design Drizzle ORM schema for PostgreSQL.
  - Implement in-memory storage for rapid prototyping.
  - Optimize move generation and analysis performance.
  - Enhance error handling and user feedback.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Persistent game state via REST API.
  - Comprehensive local setup and troubleshooting guide.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Game state can be saved, loaded, and updated via API.
  - All user actions provide clear feedback.
- **Dependencies:** Sprint 4
- **Risks:** Data loss in in-memory mode; mitigated by clear migration path to DB.

---

## Sprint 6: Testing & Documentation
- **Goals:**
  - Conduct manual UI and API testing for all user flows and edge cases.
  - Document requirements, architecture, and setup in markdown files.
  - Plan future automated testing and CI integration.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Complete documentation in `docs/`.
  - Test cases and troubleshooting tips.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - All major user flows are tested and documented.
  - Onboarding is possible with only the provided docs.
- **Dependencies:** Sprint 5
- **Risks:** Incomplete test coverage; mitigated by detailed manual test cases.
