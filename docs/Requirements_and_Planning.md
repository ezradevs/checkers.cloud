# Requirements & Planning

## Functional Requirements

### Core Gameplay
- Users can play checkers against themselves or the AI.
- Users can set up custom board positions (setup mode).
- Users can drag and drop pieces to make moves.
- Legal moves are visually indicated; illegal moves are prevented.
- Multi-jump and king promotion are fully supported.
- Users can switch board orientation.
- Move history is tracked and displayed.

### AI Analysis
- Users can request an AI analysis of the current position.
- AI analysis depth is configurable (beginner to expert).
- The best move and evaluation score are displayed.
- Visual aids: evaluation bar, move arrows, and engine lines for top moves.
- Analysis results are cached for performance.

### Game State Management
- Users can reset or clear the board.
- Game state is persisted via REST API (in-memory, with DB migration path).
- Users can retrieve, update, and create game states via API endpoints.

### Rule Variations
- Force-take and multiple capture rules are configurable.
- Support for different checkers rule sets (future roadmap).

### UI/UX
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
- Accessible UI components (keyboard navigation, ARIA roles).
- Real-time feedback for all user actions.
- Theming and dark mode support (future roadmap).

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Fast UI updates, low-latency analysis, efficient API.
- **Reliability:** Robust error handling, clear user feedback on errors.
- **Type Safety:** End-to-end TypeScript for all code.
- **Maintainability:** Modular code, clear separation of concerns, shared types.
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new features, rules, or AI improvements.
- **Security:** Input validation (Zod), safe API endpoints, no XSS/CORS issues.
- **Offline Capability:** Runs fully locally after setup.
- **Developer Experience:** Simple setup, clear documentation, hot reloads.

## User Stories

- *As a casual player, I want to play checkers against the AI so I can practice and improve.*
- *As a coach, I want to set up custom positions to demonstrate tactics to students.*
- *As a developer, I want to extend the AI engine to experiment with new evaluation functions.*
- *As a user, I want to see which moves are legal so I donâ€™t make mistakes.*
- *As a competitive player, I want to analyze my games and see the best moves suggested by the engine.*
- *As a user, I want to reset or clear the board to start new games or analysis.*

## Technical Constraints

- Node.js 18+ and modern browser required.
- PostgreSQL database (planned, currently in-memory).
- TypeScript enforced across all code.
- Monorepo structure for shared types.
- No external network dependencies after setup.

## Architectural Decisions

- **Monorepo:** Ensures type safety and consistency between frontend and backend.
- **React + Vite:** Fast, modern frontend stack with HMR and modular components.
- **Express.js Backend:** Simple, flexible API server with clear error handling.
- **Drizzle ORM:** Type-safe, modern database access with migration support.
- **Custom AI Engine:** Allows for deep integration and future enhancements.
- **In-Memory Storage:** Rapid prototyping, with a clear path to full DB migration.

## Planning Timeline

### Sprint 1: Project Foundation
- Set up monorepo, shared types, and project scaffolding.
- Implement initial board rendering and move logic.

### Sprint 2: Core Gameplay
- Drag-and-drop, setup mode, move validation.
- REST API for game state management.

### Sprint 3: AI & Analysis
- Integrate minimax engine, evaluation bar, move suggestions.
- Visual feedback for analysis results.

### Sprint 4: UI/UX Enhancements
- Build control panel, engine lines, and responsive design.
- Accessibility improvements.

### Sprint 5: Persistence & Polish
- Connect to database, optimize performance, refine UI.
- Add troubleshooting and setup documentation.

### Sprint 6: Testing & Documentation
- Manual and automated tests.
- Complete Notion/markdown documentation.

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

- **AI Complexity:** Start with depth-limited minimax, optimize later.
- **Database Migration:** Use in-memory storage first, design for easy migration.
- **UI Responsiveness:** Use React best practices, optimize rendering.
- **Developer Onboarding:** Provide clear setup and troubleshooting guides.
