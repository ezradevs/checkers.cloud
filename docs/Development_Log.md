# Development Log

## Project Inception

**2024-12-15** — *Initial Planning*
- Defined project scope: interactive checkers board with AI analysis.
- Chose monorepo structure for shared types and maintainability.
- Selected core technologies: React, TypeScript, Express, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL.

---

## Milestone 1: Project Foundation

**2024-12-18** — *Repository Setup*
- Initialized monorepo with `client/`, `server/`, and `shared/` directories.
- Configured TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend.
- Set up Express.js backend with TypeScript and ES modules.
- Established shared types in `shared/schema.ts`.

---

## Milestone 2: Core Gameplay

**2024-12-22** — *Board & Move Logic*
- Implemented checkers board rendering and drag-and-drop logic.
- Developed move validation, legal move highlighting, and multi-jump support.
- Added setup mode for custom positions.
- Created REST API endpoints for game state management.

---

## Milestone 3: AI & Analysis

**2025-01-03** — *AI Engine Integration*
- Built custom minimax engine with alpha-beta pruning.
- Added evaluation function: material, positional, mobility, and strategic factors.
- Enabled configurable analysis depth (2–5).
- Implemented analysis result caching for performance.

---

## Milestone 4: UI/UX Enhancements

**2025-01-10** — *Componentization & Visual Feedback*
- Modularized UI into CheckersBoard, ControlPanel, EvaluationBar, AnalysisResults, and EngineLines.
- Integrated shadcn/ui and Radix UI for accessible, modern components.
- Added evaluation bar, move arrows, and engine lines for visual analysis.
- Improved layout for responsiveness and clarity.

---

## Milestone 5: Persistence & Polish

**2025-01-14** — *Database & Performance*
- Designed Drizzle ORM schema for PostgreSQL; implemented in-memory storage for rapid prototyping.
- Optimized move generation and analysis performance.
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback (toasts, tooltips).
- Wrote comprehensive local setup and troubleshooting guide.

---

## Milestone 6: Testing & Documentation

**2025-01-16** — *Testing & Docs*
- Conducted manual UI and API testing for all user flows and edge cases.
- Documented requirements, architecture, and setup in markdown files.
- Planned future automated testing and CI integration.

---

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

- **Move Validation:** Ensured only legal moves are allowed, including multi-jump and king promotion logic.
- **AI Performance:** Used alpha-beta pruning and move ordering to optimize analysis speed.
- **Type Safety:** Maintained strict TypeScript types across frontend, backend, and shared code.
- **Accessibility:** Leveraged shadcn/ui and Radix UI for ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and color contrast.
- **Database Migration:** Started with in-memory storage, designed schema for seamless migration to PostgreSQL.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Monorepo Benefits:** Shared types and schemas greatly reduced bugs and improved developer experience.
- **Component Modularity:** Investing in reusable components made UI enhancements and bug fixes much easier.
- **Early Prototyping:** Using in-memory storage allowed rapid iteration before committing to database integration.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive setup and troubleshooting docs reduced onboarding friction for new contributors.

## Ongoing & Future Work

- Implement automated unit, integration, and E2E tests.
- Add user authentication and multiplayer support.
- Expand accessibility and mobile experience.
- Integrate CI/CD for automated deployments and test runs.
